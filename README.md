# VirtualCameraComposer-Example

This is a sample project for a virtual camera on macOS using the CoreMediaIO DAL plugin.
This project is heavily based on https://github.com/johnboiles/coremediaio-dal-minimal-example.

In this example, you can composite arbitrary window, front camera, and overlay text are combined to the virtual camera.
